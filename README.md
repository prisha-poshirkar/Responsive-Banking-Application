I have achieved a Professional Certificate in UI Design from UX Design Institute in March 2024.
As part of this certification course, I have completed an UI Design assignment for a Responsive Banking Application. 
For this assignment I have created a user interface design for a new banking application which works responsively across desktop, tablet and mobile screens. 
The UI Design was implemented using Figma tool.
